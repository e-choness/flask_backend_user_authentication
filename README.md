# Flask Backend User Authentication System

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based backend system designed to handle user authentication. It provides essential features such as user registration, login, session management, and more. The system is built with scalability and security in mind, making it suitable for integration into larger applications.

---

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users and provides secure sessions.
- **Session Management**: Handles user sessions securely.
- **Password Hashing**: Ensures passwords are stored securely using hashing algorithms.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful endpoints for authentication-related operations.
- **Logging**: Tracks system activity for debugging and monitoring.
- **Configuration Management**: Supports environment-specific configurations.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the system, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask framework
- Virtual environment tools (`venv` or `virtualenv`)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flask_backend_user_authentication.git
   cd flask_backend_user_authentication
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
   ```

1. Update the `config` folder with any additional settings required for your environment.

---

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## API Endpoints

### User Registration

- **Endpoint**: `/register`
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "example",
    "password": "password123"
  }
  ```

### User Login

- **Endpoint**: `/login`
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**:

  ```json
  {
    "username": "example",
    "password": "password123"
  }
  ```

### Logout

- **Endpoint**: `/logout`
- **Method**: POST

---

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory. You can configure logging settings in the `config` folder.

---

## Deployment

To deploy the application, ensure you configure the environment variables and database settings for production. Use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI for deployment.

### Example

Here are examples of deployment instructions for your Flask application:

---

### Deployment Instructions

#### Using Gunicorn (Linux/Unix)

1. Install Gunicorn:

   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. Run the application with Gunicorn:

   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
   ```

   - `-w 4`: Specifies the number of worker processes.
   - `-b 0.0.0.0:8000`: Binds the application to port 8000.

3. Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to forward requests to Gunicorn.

---

#### Using uWSGI (Linux/Unix)

1. Install uWSGI:

   ```bash
   pip install uwsgi
   ```

2. Run the application with uWSGI:

   ```bash
   uwsgi --http :8000 --module app:app --processes 4 --threads 2
   ```

   - `--http :8000`: Specifies the HTTP port.
   - `--processes 4`: Number of worker processes.
   - `--threads 2`: Number of threads per worker.

3. Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to forward requests to uWSGI.

---

#### Using Docker

1. Create a `Dockerfile`:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY . /app

   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

   CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:app"]
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-auth-app .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 flask-auth-app
   ```

---

#### Using Azure App Service

1. Install the Azure CLI:

   ```bash
   pip install azure-cli
   ```

2. Login to Azure:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. Create an App Service plan and deploy the application:

   ```bash
   az webapp up --name flask-auth-app --runtime "PYTHON:3.8"
   ```
